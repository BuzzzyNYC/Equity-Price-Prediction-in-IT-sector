### Methodology

The dataset used for this research is time series and contains 10 observations. The graphical techniques used to build this model were histogram, time series and scatter plots; the analytical methods were descriptive statistics, correlation matrix, and linear regression. Eqn. 1, 2, and 3 depict the functional specification, population regression equation, and sample regression equation, respectively. The following results were obtained using the statistical program R.
>
	Eqn. 1 Price = f (eps, bvps, cfps) 
	Eqn. 2 Price = α + βeps*EPS + βbvps*BVPS+ βcfps*CFPS 
	Eqn. 3 Price = a + beps*EPS + bbvps*BVPS+ bcfps*CFPS
